## About

This is the latest micro-mouse that we developed.

I designed and implemented the entire firmware, including:
- Flood Fill algorithm for maze-solving logic
- PID controllers for accurate motor control
- Sensor calibration for reliable wall detection and tracking

### Key Features

- **Four-Wheel Micro-Mouse Design**  
  Built according to the standard specifications used in official micromouse competitions.

- **Powered by ESP32-S3**  
  Utilizes the dual-core architecture of the ESP32-S3:
  - **Core 1** is dedicated to running the Flood Fill algorithm for path planning.
  - **Core 0** handles the real-time PID control algorithms for motor speed and direction.

- **PID Algorithm Tuned Using MATLAB**  
  The PID control logic was modeled and fine-tuned in MATLAB for optimal performance in navigating the maze.

This micro-mouse combines real-time embedded systems, control theory, and efficient pathfinding to deliver fast, intelligent maze-solving performance.
